#Ruby Assessment

    The repo contains a small rails app. The challenge is to simply look through the app for trouble areas, and make improvements. The code is small enough that it should take 60-90 minutes to complete the work.

## To start, checkout branch:

git checkout candidate_assessment
git checkout -b jsmith20160808
git push --set-upstream origin jsmith20160808
